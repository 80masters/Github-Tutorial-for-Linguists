#Github Tutorial for Linguistics

> Hello linguists!  In an effort to prolong your work and make it accessible for all, I have created this mini-tutorial for you to make use of a poowerful tool that will:
* keep track of changes you make so you can go back to an earlier version
* prevent the need for buying software products (even MS Office)
* share your research easily with others
* enable you to integrate content from multiple sources

>Github can enable you to do so much more, but the following covers the basics.
 

##First Steps: Download & Install

> There are two programs you will need to download and they are:
+ [github](https://desktop.github.com/)
+ [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

###Notes
> You can expect Sublime Text to replace Word, Excel, and FrontPage!!!
> Do download the desktop version of github and be sure to save your files in the GitHub folder from hereonin.

##Next Step: Fork and Pull
>One thing you can do to give yourself a leg up so that you have some code to copy and paste, is to **Fork** this repository of files I have created for this tutorial.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. go to the [github website](https://github.com) and login if you already haven't
2. in the search bar type **tutorial linguists**
3. click on the link that reads **80masters/github-tutorial-for-linguists**
4. on the top-right of the screen, you will see a button labelled **Fork**, click it
5. on the desktop version, click on the **\+** in the top-left corner
6. click on the word **clone** that should appear near the top-center of the screen
7. click on **Github-Tutorial-for-Linguists**
8.Click on the checkmark near the bottom-center of your screen 
9. You now have an additional folder within your computer's github folder that contains the files for this tutorial that you can edit, copy-n-paste, and/or delete at your leisure!

>If you wanted to make a change to this tutorial like an update or adding a photo or fixing a typo or adding a section on functionality, then you would:
1. open the tutorial index file using Sulbime Text
2. make the changes
3. save the file \(in sublime text\)
4. on the desktop version of github, select the tutorial github on the far right
5. then click on the broken circle
6. type in a brief description of the change
7. click on *Commit to Master* near the bottom-center of your screen
8. click on sync near the top-right of your screen

###Notes:
> You can add files to the tutorial repository simply by copying them to that folder.  They will be uploaded as part of step 7.
> This are the steps to follow when making changes to repositories that you or others create.  To integrate a change into the master copy someone else originally created, one additional step is needed and that is, to initiate a pull request, by clicking on that in the top-right of your github desktop screen.  Don't worry, if they don't want to accept the changes, they can easily revert back to an earlier version. In other words, make mistakes because it is super-easy to recover from them using github!

##Working with Your Own Repository
> You can add files such as corpus data, recordings, and images to your repository simply by saving or copying them to the directory on your computer and then pulling them into the master repository \(as stated above\).  These can then be included into your files.

<p> For example, let's say you have a recording of a participant in your study, either for pronunciation analysis or an interview.  You can then include them in the body of your writing as follows:
