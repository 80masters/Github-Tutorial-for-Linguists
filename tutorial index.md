#How to use Github in LING

> Hello linguists!  In an effort to prolong your work and make it accessible for all, I have created this mini-tutorial for you to make use of a poowerful tool that will:
* enable you to integrate 
* keep track of changes you make so you can go back to an earlier version
* prevent the need for buying software products (even office)
* share your research easily with others
 

##First Steps: Download & Install

> There are two programs you will need to download and they are:
+ [github repo](https://desktop.github.com/)
> Do download the desktop version.
+ [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
> You can expect this to replace Word, Excel, and FrontPage!!!
